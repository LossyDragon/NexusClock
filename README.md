I managed to get a Nexus 4 in my hands, well after it's been long and forgotten. 

Then I remembered back then there was the cool retro looking clock that was apparently leaked, but never released officially?

Anyways, that widget appears to be hard to find. Any apps available I found to contains the widget seem skethcy.

I found the assets for it and implemented a basic clock widget. Clicking on it should open the Clock/Alarms app./
